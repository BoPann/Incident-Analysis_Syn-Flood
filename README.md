## Wireshark Log Analyzer for SYN Flood Attack Detection
### Project Overview
This project provides a tool to analyze Wireshark logs and detect SYN flood attacks. SYN flood attacks are a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack where an attacker sends a large number of SYN packets to a target server, overwhelming its resources and making it unavailable.
