## Wireshark Log Analyzer for SYN Flood Attack Detection
### Project Overview
We simulated a cyber incident and analyzed it using incident reports and Wireshark logs. Our investigation revealed a SYN flood attack, a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
### What Happened?
An attacker bombarded a target server with an excessive number of SYN packets, overwhelming its resources and rendering it inaccessible.
### Key Findings
Incident Type: Denial of Service (DoS) - SYN Flood
Attack Vector: SYN packets sent to the target server
Impact: Server resource exhaustion, service unavailability
### Tools Used
Incident reports
Wireshark logs
### Takeaways
Understanding SYN flood attacks helps us develop effective defense strategies to prevent similar incidents.
